#### 1.1.3
Added support for custom tokenizers and sanitizers to be specified in the constructor.

```js
// prefix matching with custom tokenizer to include all non alphanumerics as delimeters
// and custom sanitizer for case-sensitive searches
const searchApi = new SearchApi({
    indexMode: INDEX_MODES.PREFIXES,
    tokenize: text => text.split(/[^a-z0-9]+/).filter(text => text),
    sanitize: text => text.trim()
})
```

#### 1.1.1
* üêõ Replaced `for..of` with `forEach` in order to support IE 11. ([@jrubins](https://github.com/jrubins) - [#6](https://github.com/bvaughn/js-worker-search/pull/6))

#### 1.1.0
Added support for custom index strategies.
By default, a prefix matching strategy is still used but it can be overridden like so:

```js
import SearchApi, { INDEX_MODES } from 'js-worker-search'

// all-substrings match by default; same as current
// eg "c", "ca", "a", "at", "cat" match "cat"
const searchApi = new SearchApi()

// prefix matching (eg "c", "ca", "cat" match "cat")
const searchApi = new SearchApi({
  indexMode: INDEX_MODES.PREFIXES
})

// exact words matching (eg only "cat" matches "cat")
const searchApi = new SearchApi({
  indexMode: INDEX_MODES.EXACT_WORDS
})
```

#### 1.0.2
Wrapped `String.prototype.charAt` usage in a `try/catch` to avoid erroring when handling surrogate halves.
In the context of a web-worker, non-BMP characters seem to cause Chrome 49.0 to crash.

#### 1.0.1
Bound indexSearch and search methods to prevent them from losing context when passed around.

# 1.0.0
Initial release; forked from [redux-search](https://github.com/treasure-data/redux-search).
